CPU bound process need the cpu for a long time like the "Virenscanner" but the user wont know that these process are running. I/O bound process are processes which are triggered by user input most of these processes dont need the cpu long but they need it as fast as possible, I/O processes are for examaple: key input by the user or a mouse klick.

I/O bound processes dont need the cpu long but as fast as possible. If these processes dont come fast to the cpu the user think that this pc is "laggy" and we dont want that

CPU bound processes dont have to run instantly it is ok if they run in 10 , 20 minutes or even in an hour. But if they came once they need the cpu for a long time.

p: 50 100 200 250 
c: 35 20 10 $x$

Summe: Ci / Pi <= 1

35/100 + 20/100 + 10/100 + x/250 = 1 0.35 + 0.2 + 0.1 + x/250 = 1 0.65 + x/250 = 1 x/250 = 0.35 x = 0.35 * 250 x = 87.5

the largest value for x , in which the system is schedulable, is 87.5
